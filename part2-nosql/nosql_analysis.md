# Module 2 – Part 2: NoSQL Database Analysis (MongoDB)

## Objective
This section addresses **Part 2 of Module 2** and focuses on analyzing the
suitability of a **NoSQL database (MongoDB)** for managing a highly diverse and
evolving product catalog at FlexiMart.

The goal is to evaluate limitations of relational databases for this use case
and justify the adoption of MongoDB from a data architecture perspective.
