## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Data Engineering workflow** at FlexiMart.
It covers the complete lifecycle from raw CSV ingestion to analytical reporting
using relational databases, NoSQL, and a data warehouse.

---

## What Was Implemented
- ETL pipeline to clean and load raw CSV data into MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Relational database schema documentation and business SQL queries
- NoSQL analysis with MongoDB for flexible product data
- Data warehouse design using a star schema
- OLAP analytics queries for sales and customer insights
